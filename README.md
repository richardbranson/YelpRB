# GA MidTerm Project

## CHALLENGE
Create a command line based application that fulfills these criteria:

1. Takes user input and handles bad input (i.e. You expect numbers and they give you a letter).
2. Connects to a 3rd party api where the call varies based on what the user gives you.
3. Must be object oriented. You must instantiate modeled classes. The only file that can run without classes is your runner.
4. Push code on Github.

You have plenty of APIs to choose from, for example:

- Quote of the day
- Twitter search API
- Rap Genius ;-)

## SOLUTION
Using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/) I'll be building an terminal application that finds stuff local to the users inputted address.

###Features & Objects

1. ask for `name`
2. search by `term`

```
search by city
search by name
allow sort
list out all corresponding
```

3. search by all

```
allow sort
list out all corresponding
```
